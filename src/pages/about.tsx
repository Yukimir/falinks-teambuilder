        This is a Pok√©mon teambuilder that works similarly to Pokemon Showdown in terms of editing, but it also allows multiple players to work on the same
        team. It means that your modifications will be mirrored in real time on the interfaces of all users in the same room. You may do this by simply sending
        your friends the room name/link to your team.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may start from scratch or import an existing Showdown paste to create a new team. You may also easily export your team to a Showdown importable or
        generate a PokePaste link.
